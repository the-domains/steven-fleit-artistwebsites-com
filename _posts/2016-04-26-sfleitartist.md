I am a self taught artist. I paint using acrylics on canvas. There is a tendency to write some interesting statement about inspiration, etc., when creating an introduction to the artists work. I am not very good at that, so I will not go there. I paint what I like, which is mostly landscapes, seascapes and reflections of things. If you like what you see, email me at sfleit@msn.com.
